        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>People who want to get a tattoo need to find the perfect tattoo artist according to their budget and preferences, at the same time, they need some sort of warranty that the tattoo artist is reliable and professional, because they know
          that getting a tattoo it is an everlasting decision and they need to make sure before getting tattoed.
        </p>
        <p>Through my web app InkTank we are going to help users to find the right style for their tattoo as the right tattoo artist for them, bearing in mind their location and budget. We also will guide them through all the stages of aftercare
          once tattooed.
        </p>
        <p>In order to clarify how to do this I’ve set a number of goals to achieve through my research interviews:</p>

        <p>1. To get a better understanding of which method do users use most when seeking inspiration for a new tattoo.</p>

        <p>2. To determine what kind of tasks users expect to be able to accomplish when using a web or app for tattoo inspiration.</p>

        <p>3. To have a better picture of how confident would the users feel by relying on an app or website their next tattoo instead of on someone else's recommendation.</p>

        <p>4. To understand what kind of features do users find useful or not when using a tattoo web or app.</p>




        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>After conducting User Interview with 3 participants we checked the results adhere is a summary of what they said:</p>

        <p>- Nobody seems to know in the first place the existence of tattoo apps. Normally the first impulse is to make the research on Google Images or via Instagram.</p>

        <p>- It’s a shared feeling the sensation of getting too many irrelevant results when looking for inspiration, no matter the method they use. </p>

        <p>- The opinion in terms of sharing the findings is quite variated. It might be determined by the number of tattoos that person already have as well as per the age. The younger the user, the more she wants to share it maybe because she is
          used to it due to the frequent use of social media.</p>

        <p>- It seems to feel easier for them to be able to book an appointment via the app, but all of them want to meet the tattoo artist beforehand, especially if it’s an important tattoo) as the first one).</p>

        <p>- Looks like the main complaint is the poor tattoo sorting on the internet or in the apps, it’s too mixed, too crowded and too confusing. It might be wise to take a close look at this as seems to be the key to bring some satisfaction among
          users.

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>Once processed all the insights from my users' interview I created Personas with the goal of giving my research a human face and narrative, ensuring my potential users always have a place when it comes to design decisions.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Once I had this clear, I was ready to prototype creating the paths my users were meant to take, we would test the prototype afterwards to check If I was right on my first attempt.</p>
        <p>I focused on 3 core features within my app: Save a tattoo, share a tattoo and book an appointment.
        </p>
        <p>With the first prototype ready, it was time to test it with my potential users in order to find problems and therefore, solutions to improve my prototype. I conducted user testing with 5 different users and I obtained a big chunk of
          information that was analyzed afterwards to start designing the prototype with better criteria</p>

        <p>Below I am going to showcase the 4 main issues founded during the Usability Test, suitable solutions for each one of them, and the evidence of such amendments on the updated prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Issue 1: Users clicking on profile icon trying to find "my saved items"
        </h3>
        <p>Suggested Change:</p>
        <p>Swap the order of the icons and adding a tag in each one to make them more easy to identify.
          Also removed the dropdown menu from the logo.
        </p>

        <h3>Issue 2: Users don’t know how to get out of the Whatsapp screen
        </h3>
        <p>Suggested Change:</p>
        <p>Increase the size of the “x” icon on the top left corner, and adding a CTA that takes them back to “my saved items” instead of to “select app to share”.</p>

        <h3>Issue 3: Users get confused with the availability of the slots on when booking an appointment.
        </h3>
        <p>Suggested Change:</p>
        <p>Highlight the available slots and low the opacity on the not available ones.
        </p>

        <h3>Issue 4: Users think that the heart iconic for “like” instead of “save tattoo”.
        </h3>
        <p>Suggested Change:</p>
        <p>Change the heart icon for another one more recognisable as “save tattoo”.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After finding a few pain points within our web app during User Testing, we have applied the required improvements to make the users' interaction smoother and more joyful.</p>
        <p>We hope that after these changes we can see some significant positive changes in the user’s behaviour increasing satisfaction, conversion and revenue.
